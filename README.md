# Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis
## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) using Python. It reads customer data from a CSV file using pandas and visualizes the results with Plotly. The analysis provides insights into the value of customers over time and helps businesses understand customer profitability and retention.
## Features

* Load and preprocess customer data from a CSV file
* Calculate Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
* Visualize CLV trends and distributions using interactive Plotly charts
* Analyze customer behavior and value over time

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.7 or higher
* pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

        git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Customer_lifetime-value_analysis.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

        cd Customer_lifetime-value_analysis

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

        python -m venv venv

4. Activate the virtual environment:

Windows:

    venv\Scripts\activate

MacOS/Linux:

    source venv/bin/activate

5. Install the required packages:

        pip install -r requirements.txt

## Data

* CSV File: The project expects a CSV file with customer transaction data. Ensure the CSV file includes columns such as CustomerID, TransactionDate, TransactionAmount, and CustomerSince. Place this file in the data directory and name it customer_acquisition_data.csv.

## Results

* Customer Lifetime Value Calculation: CLV is computed for each customer based on total transaction amount and lifetime.
* Visualizations: Interactive scatter plots showing the relationship between customer lifetime and CLV, providing insights into customer value distribution.
